# Email-Spam-Detection-NLP-Model

This repository contains an NLP machine learning model for email spam detection. The model is designed to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham) based on the text content of the emails.

## Dataset
The model has been trained on a publicly available email spam dataset, which consists of labeled emails with corresponding spam or ham labels. The dataset contains a collection of text-based features extracted from the email content, such as subject lines, body text, and sender information.

## Model Architecture
The spam detection model is built using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a combination of pre-processing steps, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms to achieve accurate spam classification.

The model architecture consists of the following key components:

* Text pre-processing: Tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
* Feature extraction: Transforming text data into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
* Classification algorithm: Training a classifier, such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or support vector machines, to predict the spam or ham label based on the extracted features.

## Usage
To use the email spam detection model, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the input email text using the same pre-processing steps used during training (e.g., tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
2. Extract features from the preprocessed email text using the same feature extraction technique employed during training (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings).
3. Load the trained classification model.
4. Feed the extracted features into the loaded model to obtain the predicted spam or ham label.

## Training and Evaluation
The spam detection model was trained on a labeled email spam dataset with a train-test split of 80-20. During training, various models and feature extraction techniques were evaluated and compared to select the best performing combination.

The evaluation metrics for the model include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model in predicting spam or ham labels.
